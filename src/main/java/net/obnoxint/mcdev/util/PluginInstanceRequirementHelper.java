 * <p>
 * This class can help to achieve a reference to any plugin instance loaded by a {@link JavaPluginLoader} if the implementing {@link Plugin} is also loaded by the same
 * JavaPluginLoader.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If used inside an instance of Thread, this class will try to acquire a reference to a Plugin-instance of the name declared in the constructor call. The run() method can also be
 * called manually but will block until the reference was acquired. It is therefore recommended to call the run() method by the start() method of a Thread-instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As soon as the reference was acquired the getPlugin() method will return the Plugin-instance. Before that it will always return null.
